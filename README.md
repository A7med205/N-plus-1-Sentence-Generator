# **n+1 Sentence Generator**

## **Description**

This CLI tool generates **n+1 sentences** - sentences that introduce **one new, unlearned word at a time** - by using a frequency-based word list while allowing some deviation from the list for natural-sounding results.

### **What is n+1?**

The n+1 principle means that each new sentence should contain only one additional unknown word compared to the learner's current vocabulary.

### **Script Logic**

* Takes a **frequency list of lemmas** (base word forms), ordered from most to least frequent.
* Skips the first **500 lemmas**.
* For each new lemma:

  1. Sends the lemma to an LLM, which generates **10 sentences (5–8 words each)** containing that lemma.
  2. **Lemmatizes** the generated sentences using **Stanza**.
  3. Selects the sentence introducing the **fewest new lemmas**.
  4. If extra new words appear, they are **added to the list before the current lemma**, ensuring adherence to the n+1 rule.
  5. Updates the list and continues the process.

### **Why this approach?**

* Complete adherence to the frequency-based order while producing n+1 sentences can result in awkward sounding sentences.
* Generating 10 sentences that simply include our current word, filtering for the one with least new words and updating the list accordingly results in a high level of adherence (\~88% adherence to list in English after 100 steps) with relatively low API costs (~$0.20 / 100 steps for English with gpt-5-mini) without being overly strict or having to break the n+1 rule.

## **Setup**

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu   # CPU-only PyTorch
pip install stanza
pip install openai
```

Set your OpenAI API key:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```

Prepare a **frequency list** file (or extract the included 1.txt sample).

---

## **Usage**

The script:

* Takes a **numbered text file** (e.g., `1.txt`) and a **step count**.
* Creates a **new numbered file** each time a sentence is added.
* Example: If a 100-step run ends with `101.txt`, use that file for the next run.

Sentences and lemmas are separated by **tab characters** in the output files.

The script prints:

* New file name
* Generated sentences
* Words reordered from further down the laist (`r-orders`)
* Words added from outside the list (`out-of-bounds`)

Stanza will download the required language model on first run if not already installed.

### **Command Example**

```bash
python lang_gen.py --steps 20 --file 1.txt --lang en --model gpt-5-mini
```

## **Notes**

* Expects **standard OpenAI structured outputs**.
* Uses **local Stanza lemmatizer** for word analysis.
* Language models and frequency lists should match the target language.
